# LODGroupHelper

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/). Adds several buttons to the inspector of the LOD Group component to make it easier to set up.

The button sets up LOD groups from slots under hierarchy with names like "NAME_LOD0", "NAME_LOD1" like [Unity FBX Importer](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.4/Documentation/Manual/importing-lod-meshes.html).

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
1. Place [LODGroupHelper.dll](https://github.com/GithubUsername/RepoName/releases/latest/download/LODGroupHelper.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
1. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
